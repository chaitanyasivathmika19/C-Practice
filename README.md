## 🧩 Programs & Key Concepts

| File Name | Description | Key Concepts Covered |
|------------|-------------|----------------------|
| `stack.c` | Implements push & pop operations using arrays | Stack LIFO, overflow/underflow handling |
| `reversestring.c` | Reverses a user-input string | String handling, loops, indexing |
| `evenoroddsum.c` | Counts even and odd numbers in an array | Arrays, modulo `%`, conditionals |
| `sta.cpp` | C++ version of the stack example | C++ syntax, stack logic using STL/custom class |

## 💻 How to Compile and Run

These programs can be compiled using the **GCC compiler** or any standard C/C++ compiler.

1. **Save the Code:**  
   Example — `stack.c`

2. **Open Terminal / CMD:**  
   Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.

3. **Compile the Program:**
   ```bash
   gcc filename.c -o outputname
*Example: `gcc stack.c -o stack_app`*


4.  Run: Execute the compiled program:
    ```
       ./outputname
   *Example: `./stack_app`*

## ✅ Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are welcome! Here’s how you can help:

1. **Fork** this repository.  
2. **Create** a new branch (e.g. `feature/new-program`).  
3. **Add** your C (or C++) program(s) with descriptive names and comments.  
4. **Update** this README’s “Programs & Key Concepts” table with your addition.  
5. **Submit** a pull request — describe your changes clearly.  

**Tips:**

- Ensure code is well-commented and readable.
