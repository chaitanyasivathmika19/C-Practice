# üöÄ C-DSA-Practice


A collection of fundamental **Data Structures & Algorithms** implemented in **C**.
This repo is designed for practicing core programming logic, strengthening your understanding of DSA basics, and preparing for coding interviews.

### üìÅ Programs Included



## üß© Programs & Key Concepts

| File | Description | Key Concepts |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `stack.c` | Implements push & pop on a stack using an array | Stack LIFO, overflow/underflow, array usage |
| `reversestring.c` | Reverses user-input string | String handling, `strlen`, indexing, loops |
| `evenoroddsum.c` | Reads an integer array and counts even & odd elements | Arrays, modulo operator `%`, conditionals |
| `sta.cpp` | C++ version / variant of stack example | C++ conventions, perhaps STL or custom stack usage |

You can extend this table if you add more programs.



| File Name | Description | Key Concepts |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| reverseString.c | Reverses the characters of a user-input string. | Array traversal, string handling (`strlen`), basic loops. |
| stack.c | Implements basic Stack operations like Push and Pop using an array. | Array-based implementation, LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) principle, Stack Overflow/Underflow checks. |
| countEvenOdd.c | Reads an array of integers and counts the total number of even and odd elements. | Array input, modulo operator (`%`), conditional logic (`if/else`). |

### üíª How to Compile and Run

These programs can be compiled using a standard C compiler like GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).

1.  Save the Code: Save the code (e.g., `stack.c`) in a file on your system.
2.  Open Terminal: Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
3.  Compile: Use the GCC compiler to create an executable:
       gcc filename.c -o outputname
        *Example: `gcc stack.c -o stack_app`*
4.  Run: Execute the compiled program:
       ./outputname
        *Example: `./stack_app`*
