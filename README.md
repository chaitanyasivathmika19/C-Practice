# 🚀 C-DSA-Practice


A collection of fundamental **Data Structures & Algorithms** implemented in **C**.
This repo is designed for practicing core programming logic, strengthening your understanding of DSA basics, and preparing for coding interviews.

## 🧩 Programs & Key Concepts

| File | Description | Key Concepts |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `stack.c` | Implements push & pop on a stack using an array | Stack LIFO, overflow/underflow, array usage |
| `reversestring.c` | Reverses user-input string | String handling, `strlen`, indexing, loops |
| `evenoroddsum.c` | Reads an integer array and counts even & odd elements | Arrays, modulo operator `%`, conditionals |
| `sta.cpp` | C++ version / variant of stack example | C++ conventions, perhaps STL or custom stack usage |

You can extend this table if you add more programs.

### 💻 How to Compile and Run

These programs can be compiled using a standard C compiler like GCC (GNU Compiler Collection).

1.  Save the Code: Save the code (e.g., `stack.c`) in a file on your system.
2.  Open Terminal: Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
3.  Compile: Use the GCC compiler to create an executable:
       gcc filename.c -o outputname
        *Example: `gcc stack.c -o stack_app`*
4.  Run: Execute the compiled program:
       ./outputname
        *Example: `./stack_app`*

## ✅ Contribution Guidelines

Contributions are welcome! Here’s how you can help:

1. **Fork** this repository.  
2. **Create** a new branch (e.g. `feature/new-program`).  
3. **Add** your C (or C++) program(s) with descriptive names and comments.  
4. **Update** this README’s “Programs & Key Concepts” table with your addition.  
5. **Submit** a pull request — describe your changes clearly.  

**Tips:**

- Ensure code is well-commented and readable.  
- Follow consistent naming and style (indentation, braces, etc.).  
- Avoid committing compiled binaries or OS-specific artifacts.  
- Add error and edge case handling wherever possible.

## 🎯 Why This Repo?

- Great for **beginners** to practice basic DSA logic in C.  
- Builds confidence before tackling advanced data structures (linked lists, trees, graphs, etc.).  
- Can be used as a base to add sorting, searching, recursion, or dynamic memory programs.
